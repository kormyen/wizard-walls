# Clashline (Chess variant)

![logo](logo.png)

Clashline is a tactical variant of chess that blends classic movement with arena-style board control. Each player commands a compact force: a bishop, knight, and castle — while shaping the battlefield using wall tokens that block, funnel, or open paths. On every turn, players choose how to spend two actions, balancing traditional moves with special attacks that place or destroy nearby walls. With knights able to slip through obstacles and victory achieved by total immobilization or elimination, Clashline rewards positioning, tempo, and creative use of terrain over rote openings.

## Requirements:
- Standard Chess board.
- White bishop, knight, castle.
- Black bishop, knight, castle.
