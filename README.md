## 🏗️ Setup

- White player places 3 wall tokens anywhere within middle 4 rows.
- Black player places 3 wall tokens anywhere within middle 4 rows.
- White player places their Bishop, Knight and Rook anywhere within their first 2 rows.
- Black player places their Bishop, Knight and Rook anywhere within their first 2 rows.

## 🕹️ Play

Players take turns. 

White goes first.

Each turn the active player takes up to two actions from four choices:

1. **Move a wizard** that you control to an empty square (without a wall token). This is a standard Chess move that depends on if the chosen wizard is a Bishop (diagonal), Knight (L shape) or Rook (vertical or horiztonal). The Knight can jump over walls like it can jump standard Chess pieces, the Bishop and Rook cannot jump over walls.

2. **Conjure a wall** token from your hand immediately adjacent to any wizard(s) you control - killing any wizard on that square. If you have no remaining wall tokens in your hand then you cannot conjure a wall. You cannot place a wall token on an existing wall token. Elect which wizard conjured the wall.

3.  **Destroy a wall** token that is immediately adjacent to any wizard(s) you control - take the single selected wall token into your hand. Elect which wizard destroyed the wall.

4. **Resurrect a wizard** of yours that was previously destroyed - placing it in any square that is immediately adjacent to TWO other wizards you control - destroying any wizard or wall token(s) on that square - take any destroyed wall tokens into your hand.

#### Examples valid turns:

2. Move Knight, build a wall with Knight.
3. Build a wall with Rook, move the Rook.
4. Build a wall with Bishop, move Rook.
5. Destory a wall with Knight, move Rook.
6. Destory a wall with Knight, build a wall with Rook.
7. Move Rook next to Knight, resurrect Bishop.
```

## 👑 Win

Points are gained for each Wizard destroyed equal to standard Chess piece rules. 

- The Knight is worth 3 points
- The Bishop is worth 3 points
- The Rook is worth 5 points

The first player to 10 or more points wins.

## 🕒 Draw

Like standard Chess **threefold repetition** allows a player to claim a draw if the exact same board position occurs three times, with the same player to move. It prevents endless games by ending the match when no real progress is made. A player must choose to claim the draw. 

## ⏳ Time

A strict maximum turn length can be enforced if both players agree. 

Tournament conditions require a strict maximum turn length.

If a player's time runs out then their turn is over, even if they have not completed their two actions.
